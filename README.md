# WEDOWIND_TAMU
The ASCE-EMI Structural Health Monitoring for Wind Energy Challenge

## Abstract
In the WEDOWIND competition, our team developed a methodology to classify critical operational states of wind turbines by employing unsupervised machine learning, specifically using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering approach. We focused on four scenarios: pitch drive failure, aerodynamic imbalance, icing events, and normal operation. By removing dataset labels and applying clustering, we separated the data into training and test subsets to evaluate model performance without pre-defined categories. This method allows for the identification of operational anomalies without the need for extensive labeled datasets, addressing key issues in wind turbine maintenance where labeled data is often limited. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively distinguishes failure modes from normal operation, showcasing the potential of unsupervised learning to improve wind turbine reliability through early detection of abnormalities and efficient categorization of various fault conditions.

## 1. State-of-the-art
Briefly introduce the reader to previous relevant methods, and explain why and how you chose your method.

## 2. Method description
Describe your method(s) in detail, so that the evaluators can understand exactly what you did for each of the three different fault events. Insert images using the "Image" button in the editor, or using CTRL-C and CTRL-V to directly copy and paste an image. Explain why you chose this method in reference to the state-of-the-art from the previous section. 

## 3. Data pre-processing
Describe how you pre-processed the data.

## 4. Results and discussion
Present the analysis results. Describe which datasets you used for training, testing and validation. Additionally, the results should be appropriately quantified via use of a confusion matrix, and a tabularised reporting of the accuracy, precision, recall and F-score metrics. Discuss the results and describe and future work planned or required.
